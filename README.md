This repository contains the source code for the Agda formalisation of the paper
"Finiteness in Cubical Type Theory".

A clickable, highlighted version of the code is available at
https://oisdk.github.io/finiteness-in-cubical-type-theory/README.html.
It is organised according to the structure of the paper, with a link to the
relevant code for every definition, lemma, and theorem.

The library was compiled with Agda version 2.6.1, using the cubical library
(https://github.com/agda/cubical) at commit
8e311a28f7d522803e6477307addfcbf4ef2b987.
